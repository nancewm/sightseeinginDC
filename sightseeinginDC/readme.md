# Sightseeing in D.C.

The map I made shows a path to follow in order to travel between a few of the major monuments on the National Mall. I used OpenStreetMap to retrieve my basemap, and used the Lincoln Memorial as the starting point as well as latitude and longitude. I then used Google Maps to map out my route and copied that URL into Maps --> GPX. I then converted that file in a different format, GeoJSON. I then used the geojson.io website to add points on my route. These two points were the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and the Washington Monument. I then saved this file as a GeoJSON but then changed the format to a .js file. I then confirmed my data was correct by using the console.log. I then utilized Leaflet in order to draw my map correctly. Next, I played around with the opacity and the dash of the line to get it where I thought looked best. I then replaced the original console.log statement in order to make the map interactive.
